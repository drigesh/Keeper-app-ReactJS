>Initially on opening the application user is taken to the home page and there is an input section to take user input in the form of ```title``` and ```details```.
After providing details this information can easily be saved to the cloud by clicking on the ```+``` button.

>As clicked ```+``` button it gets added to the list shown below the input section.
 And each item has a separate ```delete``` icon. on pressing that item gets deleted from the list as well as the cloud database.
